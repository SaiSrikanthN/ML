Machine Learning Assignment 4 is done completely using Jupiter Notebook. In this assignment, I imported few CSV files using read_csv method and trained linear regression model on Salary_Data data set and found mean squared error. Aditionally, represented the training and testing data in a scatter plot using Matplotlib library. Moreover, i trained KMeans algorithm on the K-Mean_dataset and found silhouette score of the raw data. To perform feature scaling on K-Mean_dataset, i used standard scaler method from sklearn library. Later, i trained KMeans on this Preprocessed datset and found silhouette score. when i compared these two silhouette scores, raw data gets better silhouette score than the preprocessed data.
